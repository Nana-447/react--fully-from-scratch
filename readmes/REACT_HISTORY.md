# REACT HISTORY

## Why React was created?
- Back in the days, websites were made using:
  - 1 HTML page;
	- 1 JavaScript File;
	- 1 CSS Sheet;
- More JavaScript, Less HTML;
- 2010: Angular was the standard;
- React uses MVC pattern;
- Complexity was increasing, because each part of the page was getting more functions;
- Facebook could not handle anymore their apps. In 2013, they released React on the JS Conf;
- New way to build frontend applications:
- Angular decided to rewrite the library;
- People went to React and changed it;
- Most job demand across demand;

## Reasons that React is so good?
- Do not touch HTML, let React do that for you;

- Imperative Development: 
  - Directly Change Individual Parts Of Your App, Using Events;
  - Hard To Communicate Between Specific Parts Of The Applications That Used The Same Behavior;
	- React Came Out With Declarative Approach;
	
- Declarative Development:
	- Makes The Entire Application Works Based In Events. How You Want You Application To Look Like?
	- Instead Of Saying One By One Component How It Would Be Look Like, We Can Use State To Describe How Our Application Would Look Like;

- React Concept = "Based On Whatever State Is, I'm Just Going To React And Change Everything For You";

## React architecture
- Lego Blocks!
- Everything We Build In React It's Based In Components;
    - We Can Create Components For Everything;
	- We Can Build An Entire Component And Reuse It Into Our Page;
	- Componentes Receives The Props And Builds The Html;
	- Based On The State, The Entire Component Can Be Used On The Page, Reused, Etc;
    - I Can Use Components From Other People;

## Unique direction dataflow
- Jsx = Html Inside Of Javascript Combined
- Virtual Dom = Javascript Version Of The Dom
- Unique Direction = Using State
- Easier To Debugger Because I Can Just Check What State Is Being Affected;

- With The React Robots And Its Concept, Now You Can Code Using The Virtual Dom, For:
	- React Core Robot!
	    - React Dom (Web Browser);
		- Android And Ios (React Native);
		- Vr (React 360);
		- Electron And React Desktop;
        - React To Blessed (Terminal);

## React keywords
- Declarative = React Is A Tecnology Because We Tell It A State
- State = Has A Component (Giant Javascript Object)
- Component = Is Built With Jsx And Has Props
- Creates A Virtual Dom To Update The Dom

## What a great React developer has to know?
1. Decide On Components;
    - What Is A Component?
	- Break Down The App In Different Components;
	
2. Decide The State And Where It Lives;
	- State Can Live In Different Locations Or Multiple Locations;

3. What Changes When State Changes;
    - What State Changes? What Part Of The Virtual Dom?
