# REACT HISTORY

## Why React was created?
- Back in the days, websites were made using:
  - 1 HTML page;
	- 1 JavaScript File;
	- 1 CSS Sheet;
- More JavaScript, Less HTML;
- 2010: Angular was the standard;
- React uses MVC pattern;
- Complexity was increasing, because each part of the page was getting more functions;
- Facebook could not handle anymore their apps. In 2013, they released React on the JS Conf;
- New way to build frontend applications:
- Angular decided to rewrite the library;
- People went to React and changed it;
- Most job demand across demand;

## Reasons that React is so good?
- Do not touch HTML, let React do that for you;

- Imperative Development: 
  - Directly Change Individual Parts Of Your App, Using Events;
  - Hard To Communicate Between Specific Parts Of The Applications That Used The Same Behavior;
	- React Came Out With Declarative Approach;
	
- Declarative Development:
	- Makes The Entire Application Works Based In Events. How You Want You Application To Look Like?
	- Instead Of Saying One By One Component How It Would Be Look Like, We Can Use State To Describe How Our Application Would Look Like;

- React Concept = "Based On Whatever State Is, I'm Just Going To React And Change Everything For You";
