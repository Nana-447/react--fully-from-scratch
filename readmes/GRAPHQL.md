# GRAPHQL

- What it is? It's a server language, or a query language for API's;

- <b>Without GraphQL:</b>To see the posts of a person, you have to find the "userId" on the "users" table, than get all the posts of this user on the "post" table, then get the "commentId" on the "comments" table;

- <b>Using GraphQL:</b>You mount your request filtering each field you want to see, from each table or entity you want, relating it automatically;

- Basically it converts multiple endpoints into only one or how much you want, filtering information, deleting info that you do not want to see, etc;
