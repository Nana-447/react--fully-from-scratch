# REDUX NOTES

## WHAT'S REDUX
- Redux is basically a library to help React to manage state;
- Redux allows react state to be more scalable;

## WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH STATE
- We usually have lots of components or pages with lots of different states;
- In a period of time, the states might be confusing if they get too mixed, as the image below:

## WHAT'S REDUX SOLUTION
- 1 Single State;
- Props on the components;

- Redux has only 1 massive object that describes the entire app;
